I just bought my first serious camera today in Tokyo, Japan. It's a Canon AE-1 film camera. Gorgeous. I have been eyeing up film cameras for the last couple of months.

I often see something cool on reddit and think to myself. Wow. I want to do that. Then I go through a phase of learning. Handwriting, 3D printers, drones, sewing and more...

This time film cameras. I think the physicalness of it attracted me, the way you create a physical output rather than merely flipping some bits on an SD Card.

So yep. This is my story. Day 1.
