So I saw another cool post by someone that was generating islands and I wanted to give it a go.

Since I haven't really used three.js for anything before I thought it would be a good way to learn that too.

Finished product first...

Starting out by using Perlin noise to generate some terrain, there were tons of examples of this and three.js had one on their [site](https://threejs.org/examples/?q=terr#webgl_geometry_terrain).

Then once I had that working I had to shape it into an island. After looking around for some ideas I finished up borrowing a technique from [here](https://jobtalle.com/layered_voxel_rendering.html). I essentially create a dome and multiply it with my terrain I generated in the first step.

This is the result...

Next I use the height of each part of the island to determine what colour the vertices should be.

Add some finishing touches and boom!
