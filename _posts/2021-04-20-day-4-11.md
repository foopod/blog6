## GBAGameJam - Days 4 to 11

Okay. So I may have been scared off a little by C++ again and a little frustrated at my self for not trying harding or digging deeper.

This week hasn't been very good.

But that isn't to say I haven't done anything. The [gbaDev discord](https://discord.io/gbadev) is buzzing with activity and I am enjoying learning little bits and pieces about the GBA, dev tools and other random projects people are working on.

I also watched exelotl's awesome talk on programming for GBA with nim which was super interesting, especially seeing what they are doing with h-blank effects on their project. Link [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZUM7MhWr88).

Reading [libtonc](https://www.coranac.com/tonc/text/toc.htm) in my spare time and random things I have found in the [gbadev resources page](https://gbadev.net/).

BUT JONO! DID YOU DO ANY PROGRAMMING?!?!

Well. Yes.

I made the sprite flip when you turn in the other direction. This was super easy in Butano.

``` cpp
// when moving right
cat_sprite.set_horizontal_flip(false);

// when moving left
cat_sprite.set_horizontal_flip(true);
```

See the awful state of the code and this point with the tag [day-11](https://github.com/foopod/gbaGamejam2021/releases/tag/day-11) and ignore the folder labelled wip.
