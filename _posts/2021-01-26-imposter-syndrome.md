You know that feeling, when you really want to do something, but something holds you back?

Well, I really want to get into doing more portraiture. I think about it quite often now. 

I also get this feeling though, I don't know whether it is **anxiety** or **imposter syndrome**. But something makes me feel <small>small</small>, <small><small>inadequate</small></small> and <big>**scared**</big>.

Its not just strangers, asking family and friends is the same.

The only person I am taking photos of at the moment is my fiance Athena. She is patient with me.

I am not looking for advice or help, more than anything I am venting. I am angry and disappointed with myself that I don't have the courage to do something so simple. A hurdle that for everyone else seems like a small step.
