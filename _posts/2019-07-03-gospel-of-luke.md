Recently a friend reached out to me to help him with a project he was working on. 

He is studying Theology at St Johns and wanted to highlight the role of women in the Gospel of Luke.

I am not religious in the slightest, but I liked the idea as most texts of this age downplay the impact of female characters.

We met at St Matthews to talk about it and plan each of the shots on location. And wow, what a beautiful and interesting place to take these photos.

The idea was that I would take two series of photographs, the first depicting women as they were seen in the Gospel of Luke. And the second series to recognise women that continue to or are about to undertake a role of service today.

This was my first time doing any proper portraiture work. To be honest this was the closest thing I have ever had to a proper photography gig. It was daunting. But it was also lovely working with everyone and I got to meet a lot of cool people.

This has been different to my other photography experiences. Normally I take photos for me, because I want to and because I find the subject interesting. I am not saying the subjects or the project wasn't interesting, because it was. But it was a differently feeling, its hard to describe.

I understand that this is how people make a living from photography. But perhaps I'm more content to just do my own thing. At least for now.
