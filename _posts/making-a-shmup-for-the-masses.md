### Kirby's Dreamland

Recently I watched an [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBRt2D2YN44) with Masahiro Sakurai, the designer of the original Kirby game among other amazing titles. He talks a bit about the history of platformers and how at that point in time games in general were made to be difficult. Not just for the sake of it mind you, catridges had limited sizes and developers could only fit so much content in there, so to be able to make a longer format game you had to make it hard.

He wanted the game to be accessible and a market differentiator that could attract new people into the world of gaming. So not only were you given these fun and interesting skills where you can suck in enemies and spitting them out at other ones, but you you could also just suck in air, then float over the platforms gaps and enemies heads.

This changed platforming action games forever. Games didn't have to be super difficult to be fun.

### Applying this to Shoot 'em ups

Shoot em ups have a long history of being difficult, even the genre already has some tropes in this regard with tiny hitboxes to help the player feel like they just skillfully escaped certain death. I want to take this further, I want the worst players to feel like they have some skill dodging bullet hell.

These are some of the must haves for this game...

- **Bye Bye Lives** - Lives are antiquaited, we are no longer bound by the coin slot, let's find another mechanic to punish the player for getting hit.
- **Impact** - To make any player feel skilled, if a player is to be hit, lets slow down time and give them another chance to evade. Not sure what yet, but perhaps a perfectly timed button press to perform evasive maneuvers.
- **Story** - Let's got extra on the story, get some meaningful intent on why they are going through this nightmare
- **Variety** - This is something a lot of shmups do really well already, enemies, movement, attack behaviour, visuals. Same thing for the player
- **A Gimmick** - Some interesting mechanic or multiple that let the player come up with their own strategies on how they solve problems, like Kirby for instance do I want to suck them in? can I suck someone else in to shoot at them? Maybe I just float over them?

### Core Mechanics

Some of the ideas I have come up with for a core mechanic for this game.

- **Tractor Beam** - Inspired by Kirby, maybe you are an interstellar tow truck, you can tow up to 5 space vehicles behind you at a time with your tractor beam. One button to 'swallow', another button to 'spit'.
  - Maybe towed vehicles can be hit by bullets and you lose your 'ammo' that way.
  - Maybe towed vehicles make it harder to maneuver your own craft, makes dodging harder or even impossible at max load.
  - Maybe a pacifist playthrough would be possible
- **Missions** - Inspired by Risk, every playthrough is different, maybe sometimes the aim is to wipe out all enemies, other times it is to retrieve something and return to base
  - Maybe a stealth mission, but not the annoying kind
  - A bit limited, and wouldn't be enough to make the game stand out
- **Interstellar Spy** - Maybe you have a handful of spy abilities
  - If there are no enemies around you can cloak your ship or make it look like one of theirs
  - Listen in on enemy comms to be able to out maneuver them when it comes to a fight
  - Hack turrets to give you an edge in battle
- **Interstellar Deliveries** - Deliver parcels in your missions
  - Not all obstacles are enemies, perhaps some are environmental others are the customers themselves
  - Don't worry too much about the packages, that is what insurance is for, although there might be paper work
  - Different types of encounters
    - Attacked by pirates as your leave the depot
    - Delivering court summons to a mob boss
    - Dropping off food boxes to a outcast community that tries to shoot you down with primitive technology
- **RAM MODE ACTIVATED** - Maybe with armour or a shield and strong thrusters you can ram through ships to destroy them
  - This could also explain why you have so much health or are less vulnerable
  - Might need something to slow the player down so its not super easy
    - Hacking minigame to get into places
    - Enemies that can only be rammed from behind
    - Ram can only be used when thrusters are fully charged?

### Story Elements

I had some ideas already about the story. There is a common trope in scifi where pilots have these deep and meaningful relationships with their spaceship, think Han Solo and the Millenium Falcon or Mal and Serenity.

I wanted to take this a step further, Make (pilot) and Izzy (ship) have been through a lot together, over the years Make has put a lot of time and effort into maintaining and upgrading Izzy. To the point of even installing illegal AI mods among other things. Make and Izzy spend countless nights spendinng hours in deep discussions as they float through space on seemingly endless voyages between star systems.

I see this as a great way to interject dialog in places where there wouldn't be any otherwise. Things like complimenting each others skills in battle or casually chatting about mutual hobbies on loading screens. I like the idea of some short dialog that is cute and witty to break up the action and make the game feel a bit more chill.

### Where am I at now?

At the moment I am taking my Uridium clone demo and refactoring out a bunch of classes, so it hasn't changed.

Before I go too far down the rabbit hole coding I want to spend some more time on the art side of things. My plan is to focus on the narrative, do some art and let the gameplay evolve around that.
